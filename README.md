This website is designed to show off my photography skills learned in PHOTO202 @ PSU Behrend.

The photo essay explores the intricate relationship between nature and suburban life. Through images, we highlight wildlife and plants' beauty, resilience, and coexistence within an everyday suburban setting. The aim is to showcase how nature can thrive alongside human development.

I will be adding more content as the semester progresses.
